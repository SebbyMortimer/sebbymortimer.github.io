        <p>Hello, you'll know me online as Sebby Mortimer. Actually no one knows me. Besides stossy, love you stossy. I'm a programming enthusiast and my area of expertise is game development. I'm branching out into other areas of computing including networking and the CLI. If you have anything you want to talk to me about, I'm always on Discord because I'm allergic to grass (I've got hayfever) so hit me up @wildcutepenguin. And that's the first iteration of the intro to my website, my next goal is to purchase a domain to host my website on.</p>
