				"Why the hell would I spend 10 minutes walking to Hyrule Castle when I can build the most garbage car in the history of engineering and get there in 45 minutes"
				<br>
				This basically sums up my entire experience of this game, the Ultrahand ability added so much more as well as giving you more of a purpose and reason to explore
				which is something that Breath of the Wild missed. TotK has become my favourite game and I can't wait for the sequel of the sequel.

			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size:22px;">
				This game felt like a demo for the dualshock 4 as it frequently made use of the new features in the controller, namely the touchpad.
				The origami style is very satisfying to look at as you're going through the areas and by now I've completed the game at least three times.
				I'm also very sorry to all the squirrels that I lobbed off cliffs.

			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size:22px;">
				This was the game I was most excited to play when I got my Switch. I had watched all of dannydinosaur's Dodo Airlines videos
				which really made me want to see what this was all about. I enjoyed the story and all of the tasks I was given,
				but as soon as the main progression ended and we got K.K. Slider singing the credits, I just went over to Twitch and hopped onto some treasure islands.

			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size:22px;">
				I found this game after playing Gods of Gravity, another Trass Games title, and they announced in their Discord server that they were starting
				closed alpha for their new game "Yeeps" and after watching the trailer I signed up and got in. I had a lot of fun in this game,
				especially since everyone was new and had no clue how to play and at this point I've probably played this more than any other VR game.
