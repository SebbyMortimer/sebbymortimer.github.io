	<h2>My favourite games</h2>
	
    <p class="paragraph">
		I've been looking for somewhere to document my favourite games and now that I have a website that I don't have anything to put on, I've decided to show off my favourite games here.

		Also you can click on the picture of each game to hear one of their soundtracks.

			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size:30px;">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</p>
			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size:22px;">Definitely my number one favourite game of all time. I loved being able to create mechanisms and vehicles and the OSTs were all amazing since it's made by Nintendo. This was the first open world game that I played and when I appeared on the Great Sky Island I thought that would be the entire map - you would believe how surprised I was when I dived off of the island for the first time and saw the whole map. This game had a really nice atmosphere and I would spend like 45 minutes building a vehicle to get me somewhere that I could get to in 2 minutes if I walked.</p>

			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size:30px;">Tearaway Unfolded</p>
			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size:22px;">My grandpa bought this game with his PS4 and I loved the aesthetic of the paper and origami and by now I've completed it at least three times. For a adventure game, it is very replayable and what's unique about this game, is that it uses everything on your controller and basically merges it with the game. Want to chuck a squirrel? Throw one into your controller and shoot it out. Want to give yourself a moustache? Draw on one the touch pad that's as shakey as your hands. I really loved how it turned the game controller into a game element and it made for some really mind-boggling moments.</p>

			<img style="cursor: pointer;" src="../images/ACNH.jpg" alt="Animal Crossing: New Horizons" width="100%;" onclick="playAudio(this)">
			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size:30px;">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</p>
			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size:22px;">This is the third Animal Crossing game that I've owned, before this I had played Wild World and New Leaf, however I enjoyed New Horizons the best, mostly because it's the only one that I've finished but also it just has a very nice atmosphere and I love how it's synced with real time. My only critique is the villagers are far too nice in this game which makes them feel like robots sometimes. Despite this, I love all the extra things you can do like fly on Dodo Airlines (maybe to some "treasure islands"), decorate my island with every piece of random junk and Lloid that I find and just sitting still and watching the world go by.</p>

			<img style="cursor: pointer;" src="../images/Yeeps.jpg" alt="Yeeps: Hide and Seek" width="100%;" onclick="playAudio(this)">
			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size:30px;">Yeeps: Hide and Seek</p>
			<p class="paragraph" style="font-size:22px;">I have spent more time in this VR game than any other, and have been playing since closed alpha. I also got in at the first wave of lab rats so I'm basically just bragging that I'm an OG. My favourite thing about this game is the variety of maps and items. Although it's technically "hide and seek", the creators themselves have said that they wanted it to be a hangout game, and it definitely is. I can play the seeker and hunt people down, I could make a skybase and protect myself or I could push items to their limits. After I get bored of that I can go to another map or make my own. So, yeah, endless fun and that's probably why it's my most played VR game.</p>
