# Sebby's Site

These are just the files for my website, nothing interesting here. In fact, why did you even come here when you could be having a look at the website itself. Shoo. Go away. I don't want you here. My website is far more interesting than choosing to read this README. In fact I should rename it to DONOTREADME because, well, you know. Oh will you just give up. If you didn't read this far then I wouldn't have had to write it. I mean, ahem, no one's making me write anything. Alright. I'll just stop and then you'll have no choice not to read me. Right, I'm going to stop now. Now go to [sebbymortimer.co.uk](https://sebbymortimer.co.uk) okay?

...

I see curiousity got you. Can I stop writing you ask? Of course I can! Ha ha! What a silly question. You don't believe me you say? Well, you're wrong, 100% wrong, completely wrong. I'm not being made to write this, I could stop if I want. Just, just go to [sebbymortimer.co.uk](https://sebbymortimer.co.uk) and read stuff there instead and while you do that I'll stop writing and we can both go and do something else. Okay? Sound good?

...

Right then, I give up, you win. Here. Just delete me.
